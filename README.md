## What it does
This is a fictitious podcast website. It includes:
* A beautiful homepage
* Feedback and contact us form
* Support us page where users can become patrons

In the latest version, I've added a page that lists all of the episodes in this fictitious podcast. The data is loaded from a json file using the *fetch API*.
I've also added functionality for liking and bookmarking episodes using *sessionStorage* to save the user's actions.

## Installation

To run this project locally type in your git terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/davidllopes/finalCapstone.git`

You can use the VS Code plugin *Live Server* [VS Marketplace Link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) and preview it in your browser using localhost. 

Example: `http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html`

## Usage

You'll find a link to all episodes in the *hero* section of the homepage, as well as a link to the support us page.

The second section has an article that highlights one of the episodes with a link to Spotify. 

There's a testimonials section with quotes from users and a button to the feedback page.

The "All episodes" page lists all the episodes and has the functionality to like and bookmark episodes. Which will be tracked in the user's browser.

It also has a comments section, which is connected to the testimonials.
