# HyperionDev Course Project - My Podcast

The goal of this project is to showcase my HTML/CSS/JS abilities. 

## What it does
This is a fictitious podcast website. It includes:
* A beautiful homepage
* Feedback and contact us form
* Support us page where users can become patrons

In the latest version, I've added a page that lists all of the episodes in this fictitious podcast. The data is loaded from a json file using the *fetch API*.
I've also added functionality for liking and bookmarking episodes using *sessionStorage* to save the user's actions.

## Installation


○ A table of contents to allow other people to quickly navigate
especially long or detailed READMEs.
○ An installation section that tells other users how to install your project
locally.
○ A usage section that instructs others on how to use your project after
they’ve installed it. Include screenshots of your project in action.
○ A section for credits that highlights and links to the authors of your
project if the project has been created by more than one person.
